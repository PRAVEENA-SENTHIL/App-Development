        <p className="legal-description">
        A health consultation is a professional service where you
         can discuss your health concerns and receive guidance from qualified 
         healthcare professionals. It can benefit you by providing personalized advice, 
         addressing your health issues, and helping you make informed decisions
          about your well-being.
